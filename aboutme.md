I am Denise Oyston, the manager of the **Oyston One Name Study**.  I have only recently started the study, so the information is a bit sparse at present. However, I have loads more information available and current family research is available at Ancestry.com.

### Background

I have been researching our family's history for thirty years.  **Oyston** is my married name, and I decided to study my husband's surname, because two thirds of our immediate family share **Oyston** DNA.  Initial indications, show that in United Kingdom **Oyston** is mainly found in three clusters: *Yorkshire and Durham*, *Middlesex, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire* and *South West - Dorset, Somerset and Devon*  I have also found **Oistyn** in Northern Germany.

I am married to John Oyston and we have a daughter, who is married to a New Yorker and now lives there, so hopefully our branch of Oyston is becoming worldwide.

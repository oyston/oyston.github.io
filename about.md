### Background

I have been researching our family's history for thirty years.  **Oyston** is my married name, and I decided to study my husband's surname, because two thirds of our immediate family share **Oyston** DNA.  Initial indications, show that in United Kingdom **Oyston** is mainly found in three clusters: *Yorkshire and Durham*, *Middlesex, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire* and *South West - Dorset, Somerset and Devon* 

I am married to John Oyston and we have a daughter, who is married to a New Yorker and now lives there, so hopefully our branch of Oyston is becoming worldwide.

### About Oyston Worldwide, One Name Study88

My aim with **Oyston** One Name Study is to provide an entertaining, informative and useful web site as economically as possible.  So far my only costs are **GOONS** membership and registration fee, **Oyston Online** Domain name.

For speed, security and ease, I host a *Jekyll* static generated site on Github Pages.  Github Pages allows hosting one website free of charge.  *Jekyll* websites are easy to manage and the amount of coding required is minimal.  Find out more about **[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/)**.

There are useful Youtube videos on how to use Jekyll by [Giraffe Academy](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/video-walkthroughs/).

If you only have access to a Chromebook or little hard drive space, Github provides an editor at [prose.io](https://prose.io/).  This uses **Markdown** to write webpages.  There are links under **Resources** on **Oyston Worldwide**.

You can contact me using my one name study email [oyston@one-name.org.uk](mailto:oyston@one-name.org.uk).

The **Oyston** One Name Study is a registered study at *Guild of One Name Studies* for rearching the name worldwide and hopes to discover over time the origins and meaning of the name, the main areas of where it is found and time periods.

Over the course of the study I hope to investigate the following areas.

1. Oyston families: Who are they?
1. Where do Oystons live?
1. What religions or denominations so Oystons follow.
1. What jobs do Oystons do.
1. Notable Oystons and their associates.
1. Oyston in print - books and newspapers.

Any evidence will be fully documented and indexed.
